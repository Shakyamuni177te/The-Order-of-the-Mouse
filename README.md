# The-Order-of-the-Mouse

<i>And when I shall die, take him and cut him up in little stars, and he will make the face of heaven so fine that all the world will fall in love with night and pay no worship to the garish sun.</i>

Dragon-Bear, Clown-Fox and Rabbit-Cat experience horror within the Castle of Cages and Revolving Walls.

The Order of the Mouse is an adventure game that crosses various platforms and media. It is an experiment
in the nature of art and life and the manner in which the two interconnect. It is written for and with the
help of Daisy Lewis, without whom the continuation of this project would not be possible.
