# The-Order-of-the-Mouse
Dragon-bear, Clown-Fox and Rabbit-Pig experience horror within the Castle of Cages and Revolving Walls.


The Order of the Mouse is an adventure game that crosses various platforms and media. It is an experiment
in the nature of art and life and the manner in which the two interconnect. It is written for and with the
help of Daisy Lewis, without whom the continuation of this project would not be possible.
