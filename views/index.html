			<p>"<i>If naked is the most honest you can be and society teaches you it's dirty and corrupt and a sin then no wonder this is the world we live in</i></p>
			</br><p>When Rabbit-Bean entered the forest, Clown-Fox had already removed his clothes and was dancing around the camp-fire, his bright tale dancing like
			flames around the bright of the flames, moving with an intensity that seemed almost dangerous, un-nerving. He smiled at her as he caught her eye, and
			he stared at her as he continued to dance. She had not seen any creature like him before and the sight of him make her want to hide her face in her clothes,
			to cover her fur with the soft fuzz of her paws and peak out at him him under them, like a timid huntress, to watch his impressive, scandalous dance with
			eyes that would then be hidden from him. She found that she could not. Rather, she stood there in the forest clearing and the flame burned brighter and
			brighter. All around were we small huts and around the fire mingled groups of Deer-Foxes, Night-Foxes and Bird-Foxes, as well as a host of more ordinary
			animals. More ordinary rabbits, birds and a few weasels hopped an scurried about. A lizard crawled across a tree and down into a thicket. All around the
			movement of the village arranged itself according to its whim, but the more she watched them move, the more she realised the reason for Clown-Fox's dancibng.
			Clown-Fox was conducting them all with his dance, though somehow they did not know it.
			
			As Rabbit-Bean continued to watch the unfolding scene, Clown-Fox's dancing became steadily faster, more intense and full of flourished and clever foxy 
			tricksy. The faster he danced the brighter the fire become, until at last it seemed that the whole of the forest clearing was on fire and Rabbit-Bean was
			within it, being slowly consumed by the burning, charing light that lapped against her fir and skin and eyes and tiny, rabbit nose, and yet still did not
			pain her. There was an explosion, a cloud of dust, and suddenly the image of Clown-Fox was gone. Rabbit-Bean awoke in a tiny cell within the wizard's house.
			His beard was long and his eyes we large. He looked down at Rabbit-Bean with a sneering expression of his face. Beside her was a cage within which Clown-Fox
			sat on his haunches. Rabbit-Bean looked again at his eye which we no-longer the beautiful, deep brown foxy hue they had been previously, but now swirled deep
			black and green in a sinister hypnotic pattern. The wizard looked down at Rabbit-Bean, prostrate on the floor beneath him and smiled, the edges of his mouth
			curling up as he did so. Rabbit-Bean did not like his smile. Now she wanted to hide for real, but she could not. Now her clothes too were gone, and some
			unseen force pinned her to the ground as the robbed wizard stooped towards her, his smiling growing wider as he did so. It was then that Rabbit-Bean decided
			she would like to die. A feeling she would carry with her for many years afterwards.
